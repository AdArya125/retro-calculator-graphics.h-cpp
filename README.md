# retro-calculator-graphics.h-cpp
This was supposed to be my project in 12th standard Computer Science class, but we were unable to finish it, so i hope to complete and update it here, this project is not supposed to look modern, but rather retro, with a component by component drawn ui, with the help if Graphics.h. Maybe later I'll update it in newer Graphics libraries.
